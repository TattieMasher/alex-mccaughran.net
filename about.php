                <div id="uni-summary">
                <p>During the COVID-19 lockdown, I took a decisive step towards my dream career in software development by enrolling in the Open University. Balancing full-time work with my studies required stellar time management, deep determination, and a relentless work ethic—qualities that I have cultivated throughout my journey.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a <b>First Class Honours (1:1)</b>, a result I am immensely proud of. My final project, a comprehensive software development initiative, received an exceptional <b>90%</b>, highlighting my ability to apply technical knowledge and innovative thinking to real-world challenges.</p>
                <p>Throughout my time with the Open University, I gained invaluable skills, including software development patterns (MVC, SOLID, etc.), machine learning techniques, algorithms and data structures, web development, networking protocols, system security, REST/SOAP API development, cloud computing, ITIL service management, database architecture/administration, operating system architecture, ethics in computing, and statistical analysis (the list goes on!).</p>
                <p>Of all my studies, <b>object-oriented programming</b> interested me most, and I am eager to continue leveraging this expertise in cloud environments and beyond.</p>

                <p>Thoughout my studies, and in my own endevours, I've used a number of technologies— too many to remember and count, in all honesty! Some of the software development technologies I'm most familiar and comfortable with are below. I am most proficient in Java and Python, since many of my university modules have been taught on these languages. 
                <?php include('components/tech-slider.php'); ?>
                <p>This website illustrates a few personal projects of mine, demonstrating my skills with some of these languages and frameworks. Please visit my <a class="about-link" href="projects.php">projects page</a> to see them in action! There, I showcase some of the code going into them.</p>
                <p>Through the development of these projects and University work, I have been further building upon my capabilities (both back-end and front-end) with every iteration of every project.</p>
