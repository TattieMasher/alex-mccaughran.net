I write complex multi-purpose SQL queries to pull data and support decision making at all levels of the business. I build interesting, dynamic interactive reports in Tableau to clearly present integral data to a variety of stakeholders.</p>

                    <p>During the first lockdown, I took a decisive step towards my dream career in software development by enrolling with the Open University degree program while balancing full-time work. Since then, I've maintained an excellent grade by using excellent time-management, fuelled by a deep desire to exceed at my commitments. </p>
                    <p>If my current trajectory is maintained, <b>I will graduate comfortably with a First Class Honours (1:1).</b></p>
                    <p>Throughout my time at the Open University, I have learned about software development, networking protocols, system security, web APIs, cloud computing, ITIL service management practices, database architecture/administration, operating systems, ethics in computing, statistical analysis and the list goes on(!), but <b>object-oriented programming has interested me most.</b></p>
