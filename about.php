                        <p class="about-card-description fade-in-about3">In my current role, I am primarily committed to providing valuable, data-driven business insights. I write complex, multi-purpose SQL queries to pull data and support critical decision making at all levels of the business.

                    <p>During lockdown, I took a decisive step towards my dream career in software development by enrolling in the Open University. Since then, I have maintained excellent grades whilst balancing full-time work commitments. I have done this by using stellar time management but most importantly fueled by determination to exceed my commitments- and a lot of hard work!</p>
                    <p>I am currently set to graduate with a <b>First Class Honours (1:1).</b></p>
                    <p>Throughout my time with the Open University, I have learned invaluable skills, such as software development patterns (MVC, SOLID, etc), machine learning techniques, algorithms and data structures, web development, networking protocols, system security, REST/SOAP API development, cloud computing, ITIL service management, database architecture/administration, operating system architecture, ethics in computing, statistical analysis (the list goes on!).</p>
                    <p>Of all my studies, <b>object-oriented programming</b> has interested me most and it is my dream to leverage this within a cloud environment.</p>

                <p>Thoughout my studies, and in my own endevours, I've used a number of technologies— too many to remember and count, in all honesty! Some of the software development technologies I'm most familiar and comfortable with are below. I am most proficient in Java and Python, since many of my university modules have been taught on these languages. 
                <?php include('components/tech-slider.php'); ?>
                <p>This website illustrates a few personal projects of mine, demonstrating my skills with some of these languages and frameworks. Please visit my <a class="about-link" href="projects.php">projects page</a> to see them in action! There, I showcase some of the code going into them.</p>
                <p>Through the development of these projects and University work, I have been further building upon my capabilities (both back-end and front-end) with every iteration of every project.</p>
