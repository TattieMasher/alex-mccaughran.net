        The application first loads into the screen where meals will soon be loaded. Users can 
        click a button to add a meal, which opens a <a class="about-link" href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/modal/">Semantic UI Dimmer Modal</a> 
        containing a search box.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Existing meals can be searched, selected and edited, or a new meal can be created.
        As described in my back-end contents, meals are defined as a having a name/description and 
        a collection of ingredients— each with a quantitiy and unit of quantity. If selecting an existing meal, the details 
        for it are populated into another dimmer modal (or a blank modal is rendered if no meal is selected) and the meal in question can be added to the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using this method, a list of meals containing their consituent ingredients can be created. From this list 
        screen, individual meals can be edited or deleted from the overall list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, after this, users can generate the full list of required ingredients. A list of each ingredient and their combined quantities are rendered, with 
        checkboxes on each item to allow the user to tick items off as they shop. When ticked, these items are greyed out and added to a seperate list at the bottom
        of the screen.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Users can also add another, non-meal linked shopping item— with a quantity and unit. The meal list can be returned to, if users wish to add a 
        new list and combine its ingredient contents into the existing shopping list.
